# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Introduction:
This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify credit card transactions as either normal or fraudulent.

Dependencies:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
TensorFlow
scikit-learn
Installation:

Install Python (if not already installed)
Install required libraries using pip:
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
Clone the repository or download the project files.

Usage:
Run the provided Python script in a Python environment.
Ensure that the 'creditcard.csv' file is present in the same directory as the script.
Follow the instructions in the script comments for each step of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
